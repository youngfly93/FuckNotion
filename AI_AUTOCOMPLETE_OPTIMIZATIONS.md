# AI Autocomplete Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the optimizations made to reduce latency in the AI autocomplete feature.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Caching Strategy
- **Increased cache size**: From 50 to 100 entries for better hit rates
- **Multiple cache keys**: Store completions under multiple keys (last 6/3/2 words, last 30/20/15 chars)
- **Instant cache hits**: Check cache immediately before any async operations

### 2. Request Prefetching
- **Predictive loading**: Prefetch likely next completions based on current text
- **Background processing**: Non-blocking prefetch requests
- **Smart prefetch**: Only prefetch when user accepts a completion

### 3. Reduced Delays & Throttling
- **Throttle interval**: Reduced from 500ms to 200ms
- **Debounce multiplier**: Reduced from 5x to 2x (40ms instead of 100ms)
- **IME delay**: Reduced from 10x to 5x for better Chinese input support

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- **Built-in metrics**: Track cache hit rate, response times, request counts
- **Auto-logging**: Metrics print every 30 seconds in development
- **Key metrics**:
  - Cache hit rate
  - Average response time
  - Prefetch effectiveness

### 5. API Optimizations
- **Edge caching headers**: Added cache-control headers for autocomplete responses
- **Shorter completions**: Reduced max characters from 50 to 30 for faster generation
- **No-buffer headers**: Added X-Accel-Buffering to prevent proxy delays

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimizations:
- Base delay: 20ms
- Effective delay: 100ms (5x multiplier)
- Throttle: 500ms minimum between requests
- Cache size: 50 entries
- No prefetching

### After Optimizations:
- Base delay: 20ms
- Effective delay: 40ms (2x multiplier)
- Throttle: 200ms minimum between requests
- Cache size: 100 entries with multi-key storage
- Intelligent prefetching for predicted text

## Expected Results
- **50-70% reduction** in perceived latency for cached content
- **Near-instant** response for common typing patterns
- **Improved hit rate** from enhanced caching strategy
- **Smoother experience** with predictive prefetching

## Configuration
Users can still customize settings via the `/settings` page:
- Text Length: 10-500 tokens
- Delay: 0-2000ms
- Minimum Characters: 1-20

## Monitoring Performance
Open developer console to see performance metrics:
```
